<p> <em>Hedley</em> originally consisted of <em>Jacob Hoggard, Kevin Giesbrecht, Kevin Heeres, Ryan Federau,</em> and <em>Brandon McKay.</em> The band wrote many songs such as <em>Gunnin' </em>and <em>Brave New World</em> (which were later recorded by the current <em>Hedley</em>). The original band bet <em>Jacob Hoggard</em> $150 that he wouldn't make it into the top three for <em>Canadian Idol</em>. <em>Hoggard</em> proved them wrong making it to the top three before dropping out to be with his band.
